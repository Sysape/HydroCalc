Detah@Dead Souls Dev <dchat> try alpha=.1, .2, .3, .4, etc. solve for each
one. find the two 'endpoints' which must contain the optimal value. lets say
they are .3 and .4. Then try .35. locate end points. try .33. and so on, until
you get it down to .321546789 the decimal level you want. this will minimize
the number of times you solve the main equationo.
Quixadhal@Bloodlines <dchat> you could move $eps/(3.7*$dia) outside the loop
as a single constant.
